# config-rs-ng

This is a repository for the
[re-think process](https://github.com/mehcode/config-rs/issues/321) of the
[config-rs](https://github.com/mehcode/config-rs/) crate.

## Long-Term Goal

This code is not released on crates.io!

The long-term goal of this repository is to be merged into the `config-rs`
codebase, because it aims to be the "next generation" of config-rs.

For a more detailed vision, see the [VISION](./VISION.md) document.
